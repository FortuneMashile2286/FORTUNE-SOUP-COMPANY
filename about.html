    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>
      At <strong>Fortune Soup Company</strong>, we believe that a warm meal can bring comfort, hope, and connection.
      Founded with the vision of making hearty, nourishing soup accessible to everyone, we are committed to serving
      both our community and those in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our recipes are crafted with love, using fresh ingredients to create flavors that feel like home. Beyond being
      a business, we are a movement of care and compassion. We supply soup and bread to homeless individuals, providing
      not only food but also dignity and warmth in challenging times.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every bowl we serve is a reminder that small acts of care can make a big difference. It's not just about soup —
      it's about serving hope, one cup at a time.
